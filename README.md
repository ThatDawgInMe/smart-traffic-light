# smart-traffic-light

## ðŸ“œ PROJECT BACKGROUND:

This Smart Traffic Light project integrates a **Raspberry Pi 4** and an **Arduino UNO R3** to create a smart pedestrian crossing system.

- The Raspberry Pi 4 runs a **smart object detection script** with **Smart Zones** to detect motion.
- If motion is detected (pedestrian presence), the Pi sends a **serial command** to the Arduino.
- The Arduino updates a **TFT LCD** to display "WALK" or "DON'T WALK" and controls a **traffic light module** (Red/Yellow/Green LEDs) and a **buzzer**.

This system simulates real-world pedestrian signals with enhanced safety checks.

## ðŸ–¥ SOFTWARE:

### Arduino Sketch:
- Path: `smart-traffic-light/TFTDisplayWithTone/TFTDisplayWithTone.ino`
- Tasks:
  - Display "DON'T WALK" at startup
  - Light up RED LED at startup
  - Send "start" when button is pressed
  - React to "walk", "warn", "dontwalk" commands from Raspberry Pi

### Raspberry Pi Python Scripts:
- `button_listener.py`
  - Listens for "start" from Arduino
  - Displays status messages on I2C LCD
  - Launches motion detection script

- `smart-traffic-light-MAIN.py`
  - Runs object detection with Smart Zones
  - Sends "walk", "warn", "dontwalk" to Arduino based on detected motion

---

## ðŸš¦ SYSTEM FLOW:

1. **Startup**
    - Arduino powers up
    - Red LED ON
    - TFT shows "DON'T WALK"
    - Pi shows "Waiting for Button" on I2C LCD

2. **Button Pressed**
    - Arduino sends "start" over Serial
    - Raspberry Pi launches object detection
    - Pi re-confirms "DON'T WALK" and Red light

3. **Motion Detection**
    - Pi detects motion in Smart Zone
    - Pi sends "walk" â†’ Arduino shows "WALK" (Green light)
    - After 10s, Pi sends "warn" â†’ Arduino shows "CAUTION" (Yellow light + buzzer)
    - After 5s, Pi sends "dontwalk" â†’ Arduino shows "DON'T WALK" (Red light)

âœ… Real-world pedestrian crossing simulation!
